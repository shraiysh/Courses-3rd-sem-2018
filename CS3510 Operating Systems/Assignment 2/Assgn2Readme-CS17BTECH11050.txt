##Multi-Process & Multi-Threaded Computation of Statistics

#To run multi-processing based program for statistics:

1. Compile the file `Assgn2-ProcStat-CS17BTECH11050.cpp` using
	`$ g++ Assgn2-ProcStat-CS17BTECH11050.cpp -lrt`

	The program works with console input, but in case an input file is supposed to
	be given, follow step 2.

2. Store the input in a file. Then give this file as an input to the binary file
   generated by the compilation.
    `$ ./a.out < input.txt`

The output will be displayed on the console. In case the output is needed in a file,
run `$ ./a.out < input.txt > output.txt`. This will store the output of the program
in a file named output.txt, when input.txt is the input.

#To run multi-threading based program for statistics:

1. Compile the file `Assgn2-ThStat-CS17BTECH11050.cpp` using
	`$ g++ Assgn2-ThStat-CS17BTECH11050.cpp -lpthread`

	The program works with console input, but in case an input file is supposed to
	be given, follow step 2.

2. Store the input in a file. Then give this file as an input to the binary file
   generated by the compilation.
    `$ ./a.out < input.txt`

The output will be displayed on the console. In case the output is needed in a file,
run `$ ./a.out < input.txt > output.txt`. This will store the output of the program
in a file named output.txt, when input.txt is the input.

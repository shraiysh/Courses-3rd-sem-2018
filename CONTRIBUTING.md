## First timers.

If you are contributing to open-source for the first time, here are the steps to follow:
1. Find a repository and an issue that you wish to solve
2. Fork the repository and clone it on your system
3. Create a new branch, using `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
4. Refer to the issue in every commit. Add `Fixes #<issue_number>` or anything similar
5. Once the issue is solved in your branch, checkout to master and use `git merge --squash <branch_name>` to merge the solution into your master branch in a single commit. Make sure that you refer to the issue in this commit. It's important to link the issue with pull request.
6. Push you own master branch to GitHub
7. Log on to GitHub and submit a pull request from your master branch to the original repository's master branch.
 
Don't hesitate to ask for help.

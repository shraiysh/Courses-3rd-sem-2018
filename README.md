IITH Courses 3rd Semester

Assignments(with my solutions), lecture slides and Materials are included.

## Countributing

There are some mistakes in some assignments. If someone finds them or wants to improve them, start an issue. If someone wants to work on an issue, follow these guidelines:
1. Sensible commit messages - with reference to the issue it solves. Squash multiple commits if needed.
2. Work on a new branch
(Any edits to these guidelines to make workflow smoother are welcome as a pull-request)

### First timers

See CONTRIBUTING.md

Don't hesitate to ask for help.
